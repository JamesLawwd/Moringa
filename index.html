            <li>1933 - Leaves his family's far to a lend the University of Minnesola, thanks to a Depression era program known as the National Youth Administration</li>
            <li>1935 - Has to stoo school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. I saw how food changed them, he said. "All of this left scars on me. </li>
            <li>1937 - Finishes un versity and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
            <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>

            <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
            
            <li>1944 Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 5.000 different strains of disease resistent wheat including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
            <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
            <li>1953 - crosses a short sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American brood, creating a strain that responds well to fortalizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat. 
            </li>
            <li>1962 - Visits Doth and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help miligale mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population 1970 receives the Nobel Peace Prize 1983 helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
            <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University

            <li>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050 Argues that genetically modifed crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because we ve been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds." 
            </li>
            <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95 budget cuts. Insp red by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study unde Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
